- Biography

Scott J Roberts works for GitHub and makes up his title every time he’s asked, so we’ll say he’s the Director of Bad Guy Catching. He has worked for 900lbs security gorillas, government security giants & boutiques, and financial services security firms and done his best to track down bad guys at all these places. He’s released and contributed to multiple tools for threat intelligence and malware analysis. Scott is also really good at speaking in the 3rd person.

Kyle Maxwell is a threat intelligence analyst and malware researcher, currently focused on covering DDoS and Latin America. He has contributed to several public reports on data breach analysis and frequently speaks & writes at conferences around the United States and Latin America. Previously, he led the incident response team at a large payment processor and performed digital forensics for clients across the United States at several private investigation firms. Mr. Maxwell holds a degree in Mathematics from the University of Texas at Dallas.

- Abstract

Threat intelligence analysis seems like something of a black art to many people. We intend to demystify it a bit and show how hackers can uncover international criminal conspiracies and cyber spy rings from the comfort of their own caffeine delivery systems & electronic display pods. We discuss targeting based on existing intelligence and verticals. This leads naturally to a discussion of hunting via OSINT, forensics, and reverse engineering as well as tools and systems to enhance hunting effectiveness. We also discuss appropriate response efforts in terms of internal incident response and external sharing with other organizations.
