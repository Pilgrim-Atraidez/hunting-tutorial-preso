== Title of Presentation ==

The Most Dangerous Game: Hunting and threat intelligence

== Presenters Name ==

Scott Roberts and Kyle Maxwell

== Abstract ==

Threat intelligence analysis seems like something of a black art to many people. We intend to demystify it a bit and show how hackers can uncover international criminal conspiracies and cyber spy rings from the comfort of their own caffeine delivery systems & electronic display pods.

== Bio ==

Scott J Roberts works for GitHub and makes up his title every time he’s asked, so we’ll say he’s the Director of Bad Guy Catching. He has worked for 900lbs security gorillas, government security giants & boutiques, and financial services security firms and done his best to track down bad guys at all these places. He’s released and contributed to multiple tools for threat intelligence and malware analysis. Scott is also really good at speaking in the 3rd person.

Kyle Maxwell is a math smuggler and cyber mind flayer.

== List of other conferences ==

We have not submitted or presented this material to any other conference.

== Why is this a good fit for ShmooCon ==

We believe that many people unintentionally misuse the term "threat intelligence". But understanding adversary intentions and properly tracking their infrastructure and actions can help organizations of all sorts with prevention, detection, and response.

== Previous experience ==

Kyle has presented at many conferences including DEF CON, Black Hat, various SANS conferences, and BSides across the US.

Scott has presented at ShmooCon (in 2007), SummerCon, GFIRST, BayThreat, ArchCon, multiple BSides conferences, as well as events for Facebook & OpenDNS.
